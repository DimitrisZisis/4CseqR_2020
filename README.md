4CseqR: A new pipeline to analyse 4C-seq data and investigate DNA contacts across the genome in different species 

4CSeqR is a new innovative method-pipeline based on common tools. The main goal of this pipeline-schema, which is based on existing tools and simple scripts in R statistical language, is to investigate DNA contacts across the genome based on 4C-seq data and to suggest some modifications of restriction fragment coverage estimation and normalization based on known algorithms and show advantages and possible weaknesses compared to other existing tools. The selected computational methods are studied and discussed on every step from the pre-processing of next-generation sequencing reads, through the mapping and treatment of mapped reads, the estimation and adjustment of read coverage, until the calling of significant contacts and the comparative statistical analysis of experimental variants. 4CSeqR main algorithm is developed anew in R.
